          <h3>Librarians</h3>
          <p>Libraries are usually staffed by a combination of professionally trained librarians, paraprofessional staff
            sometimes called library technicians, and support staff. Some topics related to the education of librarians
            and allied staff include accessibility of the collection, acquisition of materials, arrangement and finding
            tools, the book trade, the influence of the physical properties of the different writing materials, language
            distribution, role in education, rates of literacy, budgets, staffing, libraries for specially targeted
            audiences, architectural merit, patterns of usage, the role of libraries in a nation's cultural heritage,
            and the role of government, church or private sponsorship. Since the 1960s, issues of computerization and
            digitization have arisen.[2]

        <h1>The history of libraries </h1> began with the first efforts to organize collections of documents.[2] The
        first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing—the clay tablets in cuneiform script
        discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC. Private or personal libraries made up of written books
        appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC. In the 6th century, at the very close of the Classical
        period, the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and Alexandria.

        The Fatimids (r. 909–1171) also possessed many great libraries within their domains. The historian Ibn Abi
        Tayyi’ describes their palace library, which probably contained the largest collection of literature on earth at
        the time, as a "wonder of the world". Throughout history, along with bloody massacres, the destruction of
        libraries has been critical for conquerors who wish to destroy every trace of the vanquished community's
        recorded memory. A prominent example of this can be found in the Mongol massacre of the Nizaris at Alamut in
        1256 and the torching of their library, "the fame of which", boasts the conqueror Juwayni, "had spread
        throughout the world".[3]

        <h1>Organization</h1>
        Circulation (or Access Services/Stacks Maintenance) – Handles user accounts and the loaning/returning and
        shelving of materials.[14]
        Collection Development – Orders materials and maintains materials budgets.
        Reference – Staffs a reference desk answering questions from users (using structured reference interviews),
        instructing users, and developing library programming. Reference may be further broken down by user groups or
        materials; common collections are children's literature, young adult literature, and genealogy materials.
        Electronic Library – Responsible for providing information to users via electronic means.
        Technical Services – Works behind the scenes cataloging and processing new materials and deaccessioning weeded
        materials.</p>
